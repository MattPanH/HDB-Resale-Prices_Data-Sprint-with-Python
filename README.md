The client is WOW!, a leading real estate agency in Singapore. The HDB resale market has become increasingly competitive, with a rise in demand and volatile pricing trends. Our team was tasked to analyse the HDB resale market in Singapore and build a machine learning model to predict resale prices within a 3-day data sprint. At the end of the data sprint, our team presented our insights and recommendations to the WOW! management team.

The key objectives of the data sprint are:
<br/>1) To identify the top factors and how they influence HDB resale prices for WOW!
<br/>2) To accurately estimate HDB resale flat prices for different flat types and locations.
<br/>3) To offer competitive pricing advice for clients looking to buy or sell HDB resale flats.

The data was provided by General Assembly and uploaded on the repository for easy reference.
